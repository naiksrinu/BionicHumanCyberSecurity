# Bionic Human Cybersecurity Dataset for Impact Analysis
This repository contains the Bionic Human cybersecurity dataset for impact analysis, which has been developed to enable researchers and practitioners to assess the impact of cybersecurity threats on medical devices that are implanted or otherwise integrated with the human body.

The dataset has been developed with input from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates medical devices in the United States. The FDA's perspective on the importance of cybersecurity in medical devices is reflected in the design of the dataset and the selection of the data elements.

The dataset has been developed in accordance with relevant standards and guidelines, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 62443 standard. The dataset includes a range of data elements, such as device identification information, network topology information, and vulnerability information, that are commonly used in cybersecurity impact assessments.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a standardized cybersecurity dataset that can be used by researchers and practitioners to evaluate the impact of cybersecurity threats on medical devices. It is hoped that this dataset will contribute to the development of effective cybersecurity strategies for medical devices and improve patient safety.
